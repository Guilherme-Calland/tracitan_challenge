## What I would improve

- Improve the filter functionality. Instead of removing the text filter when the sensor type filter is selected and vice-versa, make both filters work at once.

- Change the PNG images to SVG. This will make the images higher in quality, and this, in turn, will make the app more sleek.

- Add the keyboard arrow icon to the left of the items, just like in the Figma file. This will make it so the user can easily tell if an item is expanded or not.
